The "Common Rice Disease Detector" effort aims to tackle the vital problem of rice crop 
health, which has a substantial effect on the security of food worldwide. By providing 
farmers and agricultural specialists with a tool for quickly and accurately identifying common 
rice illnesses, this research hopes to reduce losses in rice quality and output. Among our goals 
is the creation of a user-friendly application for data analysis and image recognition using 
deep learning methods, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By taking a 
picture of a leaf, users can quickly and accurately diagnose rice illnesses thanks to the usage 
of a smartphone application. We were able to precisely classify both healthy leaves and 
illnesses such as Hispa, Brownspot, and leaf blast by utilizing CNNs.  
 
As part of the research approach, photos of healthy and sick rice leaves were collected from 
Kaggle. React was used in the development of the mobile app prototype, which integrated the 
CNN illness detection algorithm. Although the three diseases stated above are the main 
emphasis of this version, future updates will try to add more rice diseases to the app's 
capabilities. Through the provision of current and useful information to stakeholders, this 
effort helps to improve food security through crop management methods.
